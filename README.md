# Qt-Image-Resizer
Basic image resizer application made with Qt. Created due to lack of easy or free alternatives.

This is my second exploration into the Qt framework with the first being overly ambitious, eventually leading to its unsuccessful completion.

The application was born out of a need to quickly and easily bulk resize images for my portfolio. I struggled to find free solutions and using MacOS's automation tools lead to annoying file names that I couldn't easily fix. I decided I'd quickly make an application that would solve my problems.

The application is very basic and the code isn't the best (I didn't have very much experience with C++ at the time) but it serves its purpose and was another great learning oppurtunity.
